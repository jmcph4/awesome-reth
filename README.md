## Execution Extensions (ExExes) ##

An [Execution Extension (ExEx)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/05/reth-exex) is code that runs in-process with Reth that has access to *reorg-aware* chain state. Consult [the official documentation](https://reth.rs/developers/exex/exex.html) for more details.

## Crawlers ##

A crawler (in the Ethereum context) is a program that indexes and gathers various metrics on different nodes within a P2P network (either at the execution or consensus layer).

 - [reth-crawler](https://github.com/Keep-Reth-Strange/reth-crawler), a crawler for EL nodes ([Tweet](https://x.com/alemaz98/status/1731961719583396119))
 - [reconnaissance](https://github.com/Will-Smith11/reconnaissance), a proxy EL node using Reth

## Indexers ##

An indexer (in the Ethereum context) takes data directly from the blockchain and produces alternative database schemas (typically relational) to allow enhanced and performant querying.

 - [reth-indexer](https://github.com/joshstevens19/reth-indexer), an indexer that accesses Reth's database directly and indexes into various backends
